        The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

        There are 3 types (hints) of it:

        "string" (for alert and other operations that need a string)
        "number" (for maths)
        "default" (few operators, usually objects implement it the same way as "number")
        The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint.

        The conversion algorithm is:

        Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) if the method exists,
        Otherwise if hint is "string"
        try calling obj.toString() or obj.valueOf(), whatever exists.
        Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default"
        try calling obj.valueOf() or obj.toString(), whatever exists.
        All these methods must return a primitive to work (if defined).

        // explicit conversion
        let obj = "112"
        console.log(typeof obj);
        let num = Number("1");
        console.log(typeof num);//to change the value from string to number
        console.log(num.__proto__);//for see prototype
    </script>
