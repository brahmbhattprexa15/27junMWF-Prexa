        There are 3 types of quotes. Backticks allow a string to span multiple lines and embed expressions ${…}.
        We can use special characters, such as a line break \n.
        To get a character, use: [] or at method.
        To get a substring, use: slice or substring.
        To lowercase/uppercase a string, use: toLowerCase/toUpperCase.
        To look for a substring, use: indexOf, or includes/startsWith/endsWith for simple checks.
        To compare strings according to the language, use: localeCompare, otherwise they are compared by character codes.
        There are several other helpful methods in strings:

        str.trim() - removes (“trims”) spaces from the beginning and end of the string.
        str.repeat(n) - repeats the string n times.
        …and more to be found in the manual.
        Strings also have methods for doing search/replace with regular expressions. But that’s big topic, so it’s explained in a separate tutorial section Regular expressions.

        Also, as of now it's important to know that strings are based on Unicode encoding, and hence there’re issues with comparisons. There’s more about Unicode in the chapter Unicode, String internals.
