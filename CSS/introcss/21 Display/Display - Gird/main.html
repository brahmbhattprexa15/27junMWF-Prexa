    <h3>Display grid</h3>
    <p>
        CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size,
        position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
    </p>

    <p>Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts
        are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child
        elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.</p>
    <h3>grid-template-columns </h3>
    <p>grid-template-columns: repeat( 3, 1fr) to column with spaces </p>
    <p>grid-template-columns: repeat( 3, 0fr) to column without spaces </p>
    <p>The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.
        The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column. </p>

    <h3> grid-template-rows</h3>
    <p> The grid-template-rows CSS property defines the line names and track sizing functions of the grid rows.</p>
    <p>The values are a space-separated list, where each value specifies the height of the respective row.</p>


    <h3> grid-auto-rows</h3>
    <p> The grid-auto-rows CSS property specifies the size of an implicitly-created grid row track or pattern of tracks.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> grid-auto-rows: min-content;</li>
        <li> grid-auto-rows: max-content;</li>
        <li> grid-auto-rows: auto;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>grid-auto-columns</h3>
    <p> The grid-auto-columns CSS property specifies the size of an implicitly-created grid column track or pattern of
        tracks.</p>

    <p>If a grid item is positioned into a column that is not explicitly sized by grid-template-columns, implicit grid
        tracks are created to hold it. This can happen either by explicitly positioning into a column that is out of
        range, or by the auto-placement algorithm creating additional columns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> grid-auto-columns: min-content;</li>
        <li> grid-auto-columns: max-content;</li>
        <li> grid-auto-columns: auto;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design
        web pages without having to use floats and positioning.</p>


    <h3>Grid Columns</h3>
    <p>The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.</p>

    <h3>Grid Rows
    </h3>
    <p>The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.</p>
    <img src="grid_rows.png" alt="">
    <h3>column gaps</h3>
    <h3>row gaps</h3>
    <h3>Grid Gaps</h3>
    <p>The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.</p>
    <img src="grid_gaps.png" alt="">

    <h3>Grid Lines</h3>
    <p> The lines between columns are called column lines.

        The lines between rows are called row lines.</p>
    <img src="grid_lines.png" alt="">


    <h3> grid-template-areas (for media query)</h3>
    <p> The grid-template-areas CSS property specifies named grid areas, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names.</p>
    <p>Those areas are not associated with any particular grid item, but can be referenced from the grid-placement properties grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, grid-column-end, and their shorthands grid-row, grid-column, and grid-area.</p>
    <pre> grid-template-areas: "a b";
        grid-template-areas:
          "a b b"
          "a c d";
        </pre>
